In this task, we used the Heart Disease Dataset to build and evaluate classification models using Decision Trees and Random Forests in Scikit-learn. After loading and preprocessing the data, we trained a Decision Tree classifier, visualized its structure, and analyzed how varying the tree depth affects model overfitting. We then trained a Random Forest model and compared its accuracy with the Decision Tree. Feature importance from the Random Forest helped identify the most influential features in predicting heart disease. Finally, we evaluated both models using cross-validation to ensure their generalization performance. This workflow demonstrated the strengths and limitations of tree-based models in classification tasks.
